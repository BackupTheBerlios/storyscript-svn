Bugs

-Identifiers starting with : are not handled properly.  Make : a ambigous op.  That should fix it.
-There are issues with PerformanceFactorialTest.  The result for high values are not correct.
-Dumping expressions to strings doesn't work near as well as it should.


Optimizations

-Be more aggressive about redundantly looking up identifiers in expression parsing.
-Expressions should be cached, so they don't have to be built up every time they are parsed.  I'm not yet sure how to go about doing this.


Features

-A predefined variable in every block that tells what level of recursion its on.-A default precision predef-var. (MAYBE)
