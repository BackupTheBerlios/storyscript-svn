TODO
This are things I plan on implementing when I have time.  For a more up to date
listing sneak into my house at night and take a look at the whiteboard in my
basement.


Bugs
-Dumping expressions to strings doesn't work near as well as it should.


Optimizations
-Identifer lookups still take a significant amount of time.  They can be sped up a lot if all
simple identifer string reside in a string pool and instead of passing around identifiers in
words we pass around indexes to the string pool.


Features
-A predefined magic variable in every block that tells what level of recursion its on.
-Finish doxygen API documentation. (!!)
-Variable should have variables and Set___ function for common types, to make it a little
easier on the user.  (These should probably be declared as virtuals in VarialbeBase.)

Refactoring
-Remove the now depricated mConst and mStatic flags from ScopeObject, as well a erradicating
any evidence of their existance (eg. constructors).
-A proper call stack would be handy.  Currently we are high-jacking the C++ call stack.
This work fine, but it limits the debuging capability.
