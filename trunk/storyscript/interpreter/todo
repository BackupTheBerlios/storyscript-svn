TODO
This are things I plan on implementing when I have time.  For a more up to date
listing sneak into my house at night and take a look at the whiteboard in my
basement.



Currently StoryScript is in self imposed feature-lock.  Right now I am working
to finalize the interface and clean up an embarssments before I start adding
a lot of new code.  Most of the modification for a while will be related to
making the api easier and more intutive.  Once I get it to a point that
I am (somewhat) happy with I will feature un-lock it.

Here is what I currently have planned.
-Interface::PresentChoice should not bass around vectors.  At the very least, typedef the thing.
-Doxygen documentation!!


Bugs
-Dumping expressions to strings doesn't work near as well as it should.


Optimizations
-Identifer lookups still take a significant amount of time.  They can be sped up a lot if all
simple identifer string reside in a string pool and instead of passing around identifiers in
words we pass around indexes to the string pool.


Features
-A predefined magic variable in every block that tells what level of recursion its on.
-Finish doxygen API documentation. (!!)
-Variable should have variables and Set___ function for common types, to make it a little
easier on the user.  (These should probably be declared as virtuals in VarialbeBase.)

Refactoring
-A proper call stack would be handy.  Currently we are high-jacking the C++ call stack.
This work fine, but it limits the debuging capability.
