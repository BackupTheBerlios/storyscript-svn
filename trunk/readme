If you are reading this, you've managed to find the super ultra-secret storyscript svn repository.  Congratulations!

Now onto business:

DIRECTORIES

The directory "storyscript" contains the actual interpreter.  Under that there is "interpreter" and "cli".  The former being the actual interpreter and the latter being the "command line interface" (cli).

"ssdocs" contains the latex documentation for StoryScript language.  You can compile this with a latex distribution into html, or pdf, or whatever you like.


DEPENDENCIES

The interpreter depends a few outside libraries, including:

-Boost Libraries (http://boost.org/)

-GNU MP BigNum Library (http://www.swox.com/gmp/)

-MPFR Library (http://www.mpfr.org/)

The CLI depends on:

-ncurses (http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html), or in windows probably pdcurses (http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/).

The documentation (ssdocs), required some type of latex distribution to build.  (See here: http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html)

The API is documented using doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).  Run 'doxygen' in the storyscript/interpreter directory to generate it.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

Currently the preferred method to build storyscript is with gnu autoconf/make.  

There are scons and ant makefiles provided but I can't guarantee that they are up to date.  In fact, they most likely aren't.  The same goes for the Visual Studio project files.

To build under windows I would recommend utilizing MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/) to build storyscript.  I try to provide MSVC project files, but most of my actual development is done in linux and those project files are notoriously outdated.  This will hopefully be remedied in the near future.


HACKING

Due to the incomplete documentation, it is a little tricky to start hacking storyscript right now.  You can have a peek at the todo lists (interpreter/todo and cli/todo) to get some idea of things I plan on doing.  Other than that, check out what there is for documentation and contact be if you get stuck or want to tell me a great idea you have for storyscript.


CONTACT

If you have any problems, please email me.  Storyscript is a pretty obscure piece of software at the moment, so I enjoy answering questions about it.
